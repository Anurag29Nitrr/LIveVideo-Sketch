# LIveVideo-Sketch
 This Python script with OpenCV transforms live camera feed into a dynamic sketch in real-time. It applies grayscale, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection for a sketch-like effect. Users can exit by pressing 'q', offering an accessible and visually engaging platform for spontaneous sketch generation.
