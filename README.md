# LIveVideo-Sketch
 This Python script with OpenCV transforms live camera feed into a dynamic sketch in real-time. It applies grayscale, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection for a sketch-like effect. Users can exit by pressing 'q', offering an accessible and visually engaging platform for spontaneous sketch generation.

# Live Sketch Drawing with OpenCV

Description:
This Python script utilizes OpenCV to create a live sketch drawing application using your computer's camera. It continuously captures video frames and processes them in real-time, providing an interactive platform for spontaneous and dynamic sketch generation.

Features:

Real-time sketch drawing from the live camera feed.
Grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection for sketch-like effects.
Exit the application by pressing 'q'.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
Installation:

Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install OpenCV: pip install opencv-python

Controls:

Press 'q' to exit the application.
